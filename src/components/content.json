    "description1": "BearNBear is a tribute to the digital collectibles created by anonymous artists, developers, and beautiful algorithms. These 17,153 pieces of artworks recall the mini artist in you. You‘ll definitely feel a sense of déjà vu as you’ve ever seen these images appearing in your textbook, doodles by a kid, or memes on the internet.",
    "description2": "By staking the artwork, you’ll have the opportunity to name it and put on a description (a love confession maybe?) Let’s collaborate on creating something fun and awake the kid at heart."

    "BBTConcepts": "We specially design the value hierarchy in sales and rewards. Also, the algorithm was applied to generate the collectibles randomly. You won’t know what you’ll get until the sale is ended. Enjoy the surprise it brings you.BearNBear symbolizes the comfort object that you want to snuggle with. Just like your imaginary friend, you give it a name and create the personality it may have. Images, names, and narratives make these artworks vivid and alive. You need to collect mini Bear Tokens (mBT) to win the right to name and write a description, in other words, you put the heart into the artwork with the artists and machines.",

      "AboutBBT": ["There are total of 17153 unique BearNBears. Each of them is created by a combination of several different artists. They have varying masks, eye colors, items and other attributes. Within the 17153 BBT, there will be 16 BBT that is rarer than others. Among these 16 BBT, 3 of them will be distributed to the last BBT sold which cost 100BNB per BBT. The rest of the BBT will be randomly distributed to other tier.",
      "With the distribution modal above, the user will only know the BearNBear they purchase once all the BBT is sold or when the sales day reach day 60. In other words, the BBT will be revealed on the day all the BBT is sold or on day 60 after the sale starts, whichever comes first.",
      "All the BBTs are already generated, but not indexed yet. There is a predetermined sequence of Hashmasks, but which one will be the first BearNBear will only be determined at the reveal day (day 60 or BBT sold out day) using a random mechanism on-chain. Due to expected high demand during the initial distribution period, we decided to limit a maximun of 20 BearNBears per transaction.",
      "The distribution period begins at 20:00 on 22 March 2021(PDT). The BearNBear are being sold according to the schedule below. After 60 days or when all the BBTs are sold (whichever is earlier), the contribution period concludes and your BearNBear will ve revealed. If unsold after the reveal phase, the sale will continue at the prevailing rate with two differences: (1) All portraits will be revealed, so you know which one you are buying and (2) there will be no bonus mBT once sales reach day 30."],

        "utilityOfmBT": "With mBT that generated from the BBT, you will be able to rename the BBT and also create a description for it. The name has to be unique and the descreiption is limited to 250 charactors. As the owner of the BBT, you have full rights on whether you want to trade the BBT with others or you simply want this work to be in the memory of yours but not others. You can choose to burn it if you have enough mBT and there is still rewards to claim.",
        "mBTDistribution": "In the initial 30 days, when you purchased a BBT, you will also be entitled of a base mBT of 4170 with another 4170 mBT for bonus which can later be claimed at the day of revealing. Don’t worry if you purchase after 30 days. You will still receive 4170 base mBT. Besides the base and bonus mBT, each BBT will also generate mBT at difference rate based on its initial price."

    "description1": "The mini Bear Token(mBT) is the native token of the BearNBear artwork. The mBT serve 3 differenct purposes: (1) it allows its holder to give their BearNBear a unique name.(2)it allows its holder to give their BearNBear a description. (3) it allows its holder to burn itslef. All the name and description changes is permanently stored and publicly visible on the Binance Blockchain.",
    "description2": "If you own a BearNBear, you can claim the mBTs that are accumulated by the BBT. Each BBT accumulated mBT in differenct speed but overall, you will at least accumulate 3,660 mBTs per year(if your BBT generate at a speed of 10 mBTs per day). If you participate in the initial contribution period, you will receive an additional 4170 mBT on top of the base 4170 mBT that we give for each BBT. To change the name or the description of the BBT, you will need to send 2000 mBTs to the contract and burn them.",

You need 2000 mBTs to change the name of your BearNBear and 2000 mBTs for changing the description. To give more deciding power over early participants, each participant in the first distribution period (30 days) will receive an additional 4170 mBTs on top of the base mBTs of 4170. User can choose to burn 12510 mBT in order to destroy BBT and claim the BNB rewards allocated for the artwork. After 10 years, the emission of new mBTs comes to a halt. From then on, mBTs can only be burnt until one day no mBTs are left and the names of the BearNBear cannot be altered anymore. The artwork is then considered complete."
